# Apoch

Epoch's base application for participating in ML contests.

Goal is to not have any Jupyter notebooks in the base repository, these should only be added in copies or forks.


# Documentation

Since most of the information in google docs gets lost across teams, all documentation should be done here or on github.

# Sweeping

Sweeping is an important part of doing competitions to find the optimal hyperparameters. In this section there will be an explanation on how to setup sweeping and configure it using wandb. The way it has been setup should also allow for other methods but that has not been tested yet.
